<p>In many ways, Glastonbury is like loads of different festivals converging on the same gorgeous countryside for the weekend. Each area of the Festival has its own character, its own loyal fans and its own special attractions: so Silver Hayes (formerly the Dance Village) is as distinct from the Green Fields as the Circus & Theatre fields are from The Park. Some people tend to stick pretty much to their favourite area for the whole weekend, but we’d heartily recommend the tapas Glastonbury experience – trying a little bit of lots of different things. Because while the Pyramid Stage will always provide the Festival’s most high profile attractions, a lot of the best experiences are to be found out on the outskirts where you least expect them. To aid you in your voyage of discovery, check out all the areas’ pages via the links on the right. </p>
