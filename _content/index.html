<p>Welcome to Brighton Japan 2015, the largest annual celebration of Japanese culture of its kind in Europe. Playing host to films, live performances, food events, a series of Supper Clubs with entertainment, and riotous weekend <em>Matsuri</em>–style street festivals, 2015 will also see the festival coincide with the arrival to Brighton of the Japanese Rugby team in preparation for their World Cup match on the 19th September 2015.</p>
