<p>Since being established in 2009, BRIGHTON JAPAN has grown year on year to become the largest festival celebrating Japanese food and culture in Europe.</p>
<p>Over the period of ten days in September, the festival plays host to films, live performances, food events, a series of Supper Clubs with entertainment, and two riotous weekend <em>Matsuri</em>–style street festivals, all taking place in the specially constructed “Japan City” in the prestigious and strategically located Old Steine Gardens in Brighton.</p>
<p>2015 will be especially exciting as the festival coincides with the arrival in Brighton of the Japanese Rugby World Cup team, who will be training in the city in preparation for the games. Brighton Japan is to become the major partner in festivities planned by Brighton & Hove Council to mark the opening weekend of the games (19<sup>th</sup>/20<sup>th</sup> September), when Japan will be playing South Africa at Brighton’s AMEX Stadium.</p>
