<p>Brighton Japan continues to grow exponentially. From a single day event five years ago, it expanded last year to a full ten day festival encompassing some of the most prestigious venues Brighton has to offer. <br />This year sees the festival move to the beautiful OLD STEINE GARDENS in the heart of Brighton for two massive weekend street festivals and a nightly programme of music and performances. We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
