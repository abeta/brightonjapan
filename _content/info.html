<p>&ldquo;The Costume Games&rdquo; has grown out of the successful Brighton Japan festival, which over five years played host to what is now the largest outdoor Cosplay event in the UK. The festival has been developed with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council to celebrate the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup, and is supported with a grant from the Rugby World Cup's "spectaculars" budget.</p>
<p>The Rugby World Cup will be promoting The Costume Games as one of the principal opening weekend events in their UK wide Festival of Rugby.</p>
