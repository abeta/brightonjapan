<p>We're thinking big for Brighton Japan 2015. A full programme of films, supper clubs, events, performances and concerts will culminate in the world's first ever <strong>Cosplay Carnival</strong> on the 19th September, which will feature hundreds of Cosplays proceeding along Madeira Drive as part of the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup. We're also thrilled to be able to announce that street artists Lady Aiko and Dan & Kozy will be taking up residancy for the festival, creating world-class street art around the city. </p>
