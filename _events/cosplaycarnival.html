<p>Derived from the words “costume” and “play,” Cosplay is the name given to the fashion of dressing up as popular characters from the world of <em>anime</em> (animation), film, games and <em>manga</em> (comics). Originating in Japan, it has now become a global phenomenon with large conventions taking place all over the world.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2009, Brighton Japan has become the largest outdoor Cosplay festival in the UK, attracting ever larger numbers of Cosplayers to its Pop Culture Weekend….</p>
<p>…but now it is about to get even bigger. To coincide with the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup, Brighton Japan will be teaming up with the Brighton & Hove City Council to create the world’s first <strong>Cosplay Carnival</strong>.</p>
<p>With the support of the award-winning <strong>Paraiso School of Samba</strong>, the Cosplay Carnival will be launched from “Japan City” in the Old Steine Gardens and proceed down Madeira Drive as part of the festivities planned there.</p>
<p>Perhaps for the first time ever, the wider populace and those who have never heard of Cosplay will be encouraged to take part. People from different social and ethnic backgrounds, the old and the young, will join together for a unique celebration of modern culture.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the Cosplay Carnival, Brighton Japan’s ten day residency at the Old Steine Gardens will be used to invite people to prepare their costumes for the Carnival.</p>
<p>We are honoured to have some of the biggest names working today in costumes to help us with this project, including <strong>Graham Churchyard</strong>, Costume Special Effects Supervisor on the Batman and Harry Potter movies.</p>
<p>Taking place in the city of Gay Pride, the Cosplay Carnival will give renewed expression to the irrepressible spirit of Brighton to celebrate difference.</p>
<p>We look forward to having you on board!</p>
