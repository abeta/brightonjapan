<p>For the opening day of The Costume Games we will be inviting you&nbsp;to come to the Old Steine Gardens to join with&nbsp;Lady Aiko and other renowned artists and create something incredible: a piece of installation art that will become the home of The Costume Games for the next five days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lady Aiko will curate the evening with films, workshops and performances.</p>
<p>There will also be a very special MOSHIMO Supper Club featuring Japanese entertainment (with a limited capacity of 120 people).</p>
